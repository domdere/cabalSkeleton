## Building the project

The project must be "configured" at least once everytime `$name;format="camel"$.cabal` changes, this can be done with:

    cabal configure

If you wish to run the unit tests you will have to run:

    cabal configure --enable-tests

Then finally build it with:

    cabal build

See `cabal build --help` for more build options.

## Running Unit Tests

**After** running `cabal build`, you can run the unit tests with the command:

    cabal test

## Adding Unit tests

Unit tests are written with [**doctest**] [doctest-github], for instructions on how to add unit tests
see the **doctest** [**User Guide**] [doctest-userguide].

Currently only files in the `src/` directory are searched for tests, it is assumed that the code in `main/`
is a thin layer of code that uses modules from `src/`.

## Development: Cabal Dependency Hell?

Cabal's great, but when you are developing a few different projects with their own dependency chains, sometimes installing all your libraries to the same place causes problems,

Consider trying [`cabal-dev`] [cabal-dev]. In terms of using it, all thats required is replacing `cabal` with `cabal-dev` in all the above command lines.

It will download and install all the dependencies for your project and install them in a `cabal-dev/` directory in your project directory, and they will only be used for this project.
